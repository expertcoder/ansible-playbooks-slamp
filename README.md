# SLAMP Server

Please see full documentation at [Repo wiki page](wiki)

SLAMP is an ansible playbook which can easily provision a LAMP server with a common configuration so you can get your new server up and running quickly. The S in SLAMP stands for Symfony, the project is given this name, as it has some minor tweaks for Symfony, however it works great for any PHP application.
